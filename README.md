# Data Analysis Project Following CRISP-DM Methodology

## Overview

An AI and machine learning project where I had to analyse a data set and make a prediction.
This project implements a data analysis workflow following the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. The project involves various stages from understanding the business problem to deploying the model and inferring insights from the data.

## CRISP-DM Methodology

CRISP-DM consists of six major phases:

1. **Business Understanding**: Understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collecting initial data and getting familiar with it to identify data quality issues.
3. **Data Preparation**: Preparing the final dataset for modeling by cleaning and transforming data.
4. **Modeling**: Selecting and applying appropriate modeling techniques.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model to ensure it meets business objectives.

Documentation following all steps is available.
